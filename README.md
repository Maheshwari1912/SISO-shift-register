# SISO-shift-register
**Aim of Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register:**

The primary aim of a Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register is to temporarily store binary data and shift it one bit at a time, either to the right or to the left, based on a clock pulse. 

In a SISO shift register, data is inputted and outputted sequentially, one bit at a time, making it useful for serial communication and data manipulation tasks where data needs to be processed or transmitted serially.
